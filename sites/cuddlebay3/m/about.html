				<p>My name is Izabela Dec and I live in Oslo.</p>
				<p>For over 20 years I have been working for international companies as a finance expert. In parallel, I have been running temporary home for abused dogs for couple of years.</p>
				<p>At certain point of my life I have decided to fully focus on what makes me really happy, which is taking care of our four-legged, furry loved ones. I have turned my hobby into a full-time occupation and this is how <b>Cuddle Bay was born.</b></p>
				<p>I am now <b>professional pet sitter certified from COAPE</b> - Centre Of Applied Pet Ethology, with the license to provide <b>pet hotel services.</b></p>
				<p>I invite you to my cozy, pet friendly zone at Cuddle Bay in Oslo. <b>Cuddle Bay is not just a place. Above all, it is a state of mind where the animal well being and respect are the top priority.</b></p>
				<p>My mission is to provide trusted in-home pet care so you can travel worry free and be sure your loved one feels comfy and happy.</p>
