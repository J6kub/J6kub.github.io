    <h1>Day 1: Organizations and Their Environment</h1>

    <h2>1. Natural vs Rational Perspectives</h2>
    <p><strong>Rational Perspective:</strong> Views organizations as goal-oriented, structured systems designed to achieve specific ends through formal rules and hierarchy (like a machine).</p>
    <p><strong>Natural Perspective:</strong> Sees organizations as organic, living systems with informal networks, internal politics, and a focus on survival rather than just efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A software company may have a formal hierarchy (rational), but team collaboration and social norms (natural) often dictate how work gets done.</p>

    <h2>2. Resource Dependency Theory (RDT)</h2>
    <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> Organizations depend on external resources and must manage relationships to reduce uncertainty and dependence.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Concepts:</strong> Power, dependence, strategic alliances</li>
      <li><strong>Application:</strong> Forming joint ventures or lobbying to manage external pressures</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> An IT firm relying on a cloud provider may diversify providers or invest in its own infrastructure to reduce dependency.</p>

    <h2>3. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)</h2>
    <p><strong>Main Concern:</strong> Organizations seek to minimize the cost of transactions (e.g., negotiating, contracting, monitoring).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Asset specificity, bounded rationality, opportunism</li>
      <li><strong>Make vs Buy:</strong> Firms internalize operations when external markets are too costly or risky.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company may hire in-house developers (make) instead of outsourcing (buy) to avoid coordination problems and protect proprietary knowledge.</p>
