			<h2>What is a Good System?</h2>
			<p>A good system is characterized by several key attributes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> The system should be intuitive, allowing users to navigate and complete tasks without confusion.</li>
				<li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> New users should be able to quickly understand how to use the system, minimizing the learning curve.</li>
				<li><strong>Positive User Experience:</strong> A good system fosters a positive attitude among users, making them feel valued and respected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As noted in "Shaka Laka 1990," creating a friendly and engaging environment is essential for user satisfaction.</p>

			<h2>Accessibility vs. Usability</h2>
			<p>While both accessibility and usability are crucial, they serve different purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. It ensures that everyone can use the system, regardless of their abilities.</li>
				<li><strong>Usability:</strong> Focuses on how easy and efficient a system is to use for all users, not just those with disabilities.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Why is Accessibility Important?</h2>
			<p>Accessibility is not just a legal requirement; it is a moral imperative:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In Norway, 1 in 5 individuals aged 16 to 66 has a disability, highlighting the need for inclusive design.</li>
				<li>Aging populations experience cognitive decline, making accessibility even more critical.</li>
				<li>Lack of accessibility can lead to the exclusion of individuals from essential services and opportunities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By ensuring accessibility, we create a more inclusive society where everyone can participate.</p>

			<h2>Addressing Exclusion</h2>
			<p>Exclusion can occur based on various factors, including race, gender, and ability. It is essential to foster an environment of kindness and inclusivity:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Encouraging empathy and understanding among users can help bridge gaps.</li>
				<li>More inclusive systems lead to better outcomes for everyone.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Approaches to Accessibility</h2>
			<p>Two key approaches to accessibility are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Universal Design:</strong> This approach aims to create a single experience that is accessible to the greatest extent possible for all users. It emphasizes inclusivity from the outset.</li>
				<li><strong>Inclusive Design:</strong> A more refined version of universal design, inclusive design acknowledges that total inclusion may not be feasible but strives to include as many users as possible. It simplifies processes and reduces barriers.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Ensuring Accessibility</h2>
			<p>To ensure accessibility in design, consider the following actions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Involve people with special needs in the design process to gather valuable insights.</li>
				<li>Adhere to established guidelines and evaluate designs against them to ensure compliance.</li>
				<li>Be mindful of the diverse needs of users and acknowledge that differences exist.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By taking these steps, designers can create systems that are not only functional but also welcoming to all users.</p>
