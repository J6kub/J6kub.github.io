			<h2>Jakob's Law</h2>
			<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites, so they expect your site to work similarly. This means:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design intuitively, matching users' mental models.</li>
				<li>Utilize familiar layouts and navigation patterns.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A user familiar with the layout of popular e-commerce sites will expect similar navigation on your site.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Fitts's Law</h2>
			<p>This law states that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. Key points include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Buttons should be large enough to click easily (minimum target size: 44x44 px).</li>
				<li>Place buttons in easily accessible areas.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A large "Buy Now" button at the bottom of a product page is easier to click than a small one tucked away in a corner.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
			<p>This law suggests that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. To apply this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simplify choices by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps.</li>
				<li>Highlight recommended options to guide users.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A checkout process that asks for shipping information first, then payment details, reduces cognitive load.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Miller's Law</h2>
			<p>The average person can hold about 7 Â± 2 items in their working memory. To reduce cognitive load:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Limit the amount of information presented at once.</li>
				<li>Chunk information into smaller, manageable units.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> Grouping related items in a menu helps users navigate more easily.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Postel's Law</h2>
			<p>This law emphasizes being tolerant of user input. Key practices include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide clear feedback for user actions.</li>
				<li>Be flexible with user errors and guide them back on track.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> If a user enters an incorrect format for a phone number, provide a gentle prompt to correct it.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h2>
			<p>Users often perceive more aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable. To leverage this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Invest in good visual design to enhance user perception.</li>
				<li>Use attractive layouts to mask minor usability issues.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A beautifully designed app may receive more positive feedback, even if it has some usability flaws.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Von Restorff Effect</h2>
			<p>This effect states that an item that stands out is more likely to be remembered. To apply this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make important information visually distinctive.</li>
				<li>Use restraint to avoid overwhelming users with too many highlights.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> Highlighting a special offer in a bright color can draw attention and increase conversions.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Doherty Threshold</h2>
			<p>This law states that users need feedback within 400 ms to maintain their attention. To implement this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide immediate feedback for user actions.</li>
				<li>Use animations or progress indicators to make waiting tolerable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A loading animation during data retrieval keeps users engaged and reduces perceived wait time.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Combining UX Laws</h2>
			<p>Understanding how these laws interact can enhance user experience:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Jakob's Law + Fitts's Law:</strong> By designing familiar layouts with large, easily clickable buttons, users can navigate intuitively.</li>
				<li><strong>Hick's Law + Miller's Law:</strong> Simplifying choices while limiting information overload helps users make decisions quickly and confidently.</li>
				<li><strong>Doherty Threshold + Aesthetic-Usability Effect:</strong> Providing quick feedback in an attractive interface can enhance user satisfaction and trust.</li>
			</ul>
