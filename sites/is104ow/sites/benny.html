        <section>
            <h2>1. Visibility</h2>
            <p>Visibility ensures that users can easily perceive the available actions and system status. When key functions and feedback are visible, users feel more in control.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A search bar prominently placed at the top of a webpage helps users locate it quickly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Consistency</h2>
            <p>Consistency ensures uniformity in design elements and behavior across the system. This makes interfaces predictable and easier to learn.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using the same icons for navigation across all pages of a website.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Feedback</h2>
            <p>Feedback provides users with immediate information about their actions and the systemâ€™s response. It confirms whether actions were successful or require correction.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Showing a confirmation message after a user submits a form.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Affordance</h2>
            <p>Affordance refers to design elements that suggest their intended use. This makes it easier for users to understand how to interact with them.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A button with a 3D effect that looks clickable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Simplicity</h2>
            <p>Simplicity focuses on reducing complexity to create straightforward and intuitive designs. Avoiding clutter enhances user understanding and task completion.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A minimalist webpage with only essential options presented clearly.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Control</h2>
            <p>Control ensures that users feel empowered and can direct their interactions with the system. It prevents the system from making decisions without user input.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Providing users the option to cancel or undo an action.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Error Prevention and Recovery</h2>
            <p>This principle focuses on reducing the likelihood of errors and providing easy recovery mechanisms when errors occur.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Displaying a warning before permanently deleting a file.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Flexibility</h2>
            <p>Flexibility allows systems to accommodate different user needs and preferences. This includes providing multiple ways to accomplish tasks.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Offering both keyboard shortcuts and a menu for performing the same actions.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Learnability</h2>
            <p>Learnability ensures that users can quickly understand and operate the system, especially for new users. Intuitive design plays a key role here.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using tooltips to guide first-time users through the interface.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Robustness</h2>
            <p>Robustness ensures that systems are reliable and can handle unexpected inputs or situations without breaking down.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A mobile app that continues functioning even when offline.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Scalability</h2>
            <p>Scalability ensures that systems can handle increased demand, users, or data without performance degradation.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A cloud service capable of supporting millions of users simultaneously.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>12. Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility focuses on designing systems that are usable by people with diverse abilities, including those with disabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Adding screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation for visually impaired users.</p>
