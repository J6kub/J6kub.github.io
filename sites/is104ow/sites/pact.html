			<h2>PACT Analysis</h2>
			<p>PACT analysis is a framework used to understand the interplay between four key elements in user-centered design: People, Activities, Contexts, and Technologies. Each component plays a crucial role in shaping the design process.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>People</h2>
			<p>This element focuses on the users of the system. Understanding who the users are, their demographics, skills, and preferences is essential. Considerations include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User characteristics (age, gender, experience level)</li>
				<li>Needs and motivations for using the system</li>
				<li>Potential challenges or limitations users may face</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> If designing a fitness app, knowing that your target audience is primarily young adults who are tech-savvy can influence the app's design and features.</p>
			<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Tailoring the design to the specific characteristics of users ensures that the system meets their needs effectively, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Activities</h2>
			<p>Activities refer to the tasks that users will perform using the system. This includes understanding:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The specific goals users want to achieve</li>
				<li>The steps involved in completing these tasks</li>
				<li>How users interact with the system during these activities</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> In an online banking application, users may want to check their balance, transfer funds, or pay bills. Understanding these activities helps in designing a streamlined user interface.</p>
			<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Identifying user activities allows designers to create intuitive workflows that facilitate task completion, reducing frustration and improving efficiency.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Contexts</h2>
			<p>Contexts encompass the environments in which users will interact with the system. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Physical settings (office, home, outdoors)</li>
				<li>Social contexts (individual use, collaborative settings)</li>
				<li>Technological environments (devices used, network conditions)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> A mobile app designed for use in public transportation must consider factors like limited screen space and potential distractions.</p>
			<p><strong>Importance:</strong> Understanding the context helps in designing systems that are adaptable to various situations, ensuring usability and accessibility in real-world scenarios.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Technologies</h2>
			<p>This element focuses on the tools and technologies that will be used to support user activities. Considerations include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The types of devices (smartphones, tablets, computers)</li>
				<li>Software applications and platforms</li>
				<li>Technological constraints and capabilities</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Example:</strong> If developing a web application, knowing that users will access it primarily through mobile devices can influence responsive design choices.</p>
			<p><strong>Importance:</strong> By analyzing the technologies involved, designers can ensure compatibility and optimize user experiences, leading to higher adoption rates and user satisfaction.</p>
