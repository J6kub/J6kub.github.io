			<h2>What are Personas?</h2>
			<p>Personas are representations of the people that the system is designed for. They are imaginary descriptions of users based on understanding developed through interviews, questionnaires, and observations.</p>
			<p>Personas represent the desires and needs of users, particularly during the idea generation stage.</p>
			<p><strong>Key Elements of Developing Personas:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Personas need to have specific goals.</li>
				<li>They want to accomplish tasks using your system.</li>
				<li>Evaluate personas through PACT analysis (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What are Scenarios?</h2>
			<p>Scenarios are stories designed to illustrate real-world experiences of people interacting with a system. They can be abstract or concrete and serve as input for creating use cases for developers.</p>
			<p><strong>Components of Scenarios:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Story/Background:</strong> Who is the user?</li>
				<li><strong>Actions:</strong> What actions need to be completed?</li>
				<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Why does the user want to finish those actions?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Examples of scenarios might include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A user wants to quickly find a product on an e-commerce site.</li>
				<li>A customer needs to reset their password on a banking app.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Why Use Personas and Scenarios?</h2>
			<p>Understanding who the user is and why they come to the site or app helps in designing better experiences that meet their goals. This approach ensures that the system is user-centered and addresses real needs.</p>
