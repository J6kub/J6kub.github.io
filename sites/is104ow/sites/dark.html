			<h2>Understanding Dark UX</h2>
			<p>Dark UX refers to design practices that manipulate users into making choices that may not be in their best interest. These tactics often prioritize business goals over user experience, leading to frustration and distrust.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>What is Dark UX?</h2>
			<p>Dark UX encompasses various design strategies that exploit cognitive biases and user behavior. These practices can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong> Presenting a product as free, only to reveal hidden fees later.</li>
				<li><strong>Forced Continuity:</strong> Making it difficult for users to cancel subscriptions after a free trial.</li>
				<li><strong>Misleading Buttons:</strong> Using deceptive labels on buttons (e.g., "No thanks" that actually subscribes the user).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Examples of Dark UX</h2>

				<li><strong>Cookie Consent Banners:</strong> Websites that use confusing language to trick users into accepting cookies without clear options to decline.</li>
				<li><strong>Endless Scrolling:</strong> Social media platforms that keep users engaged by automatically loading more content, making it hard to stop browsing.</li>
			</ul>
