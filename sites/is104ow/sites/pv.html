			<h2>Envisionment</h2>
			<p>Envisionment involves visualizing ideas to share them with others, making it easier to explain concepts and externalize thoughts. This process can take various forms, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stories and storyboards</li>
				<li>Navigation maps</li>
				<li>Wireframes</li>
				<li>Prototypes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The purpose of envisionment is to create a space for exploring alternatives and different perspectives, while being mindful of constraints such as technology and resources.</p>

			<h2>Creativity in Envisionment</h2>
			<p>Creativity can be assessed through:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Fluency:</strong> The speed and quantity of ideas generated.</li>
				<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The diversity of ideas produced.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having multiple ideas to choose from can facilitate finding the best solution, although there is a risk of developing many variations of a single idea.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Storyboards</h2>
			<p>Storyboards utilize a simple, cartoon-like structure to represent key moments from the interactive experience. They help visualize the 'flow' of the experience and are linked to personas and scenarios based on user information.</p>
			<p><strong>Tips for Storyboards:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Include two scenes of story development.</li>
				<li>Highlight the climax.</li>
				<li>Conclude with an ending scene.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Consider the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What need is filled by the digital tool?</li>
				<li>What motivates someone to use the digital tool?</li>
				<li>What specific task is accomplished?</li>
				<li>What steps are involved?</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>Wireframes focus on the structure of pages or application screens. They are effective for defining screen layouts but are not ideal for demonstrating interactivity or flow. Using wireframes alongside navigation maps can provide a basic overview of the interface.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Prototypes</h2>
			<p>Prototypes are concrete but partial representations of a system design and can be used at various stages of the design process. They can range from simple paper models to more complex digital implementations.</p>
			<p><strong>Types of Prototypes:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Low Fidelity:</strong> Typically made from paper, inviting changes and focusing on key aspects of interaction without relying on technology.</li>
				<li><strong>High Fidelity:</strong> These resemble the anticipated solution closely, focusing on details as ideas become more confirmed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Prototypes should be interactive and easy to replicate and distribute, allowing for timing evaluations and addressing technical problems.</p>
